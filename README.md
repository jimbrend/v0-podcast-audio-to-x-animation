Has a basic speaker detection system that:
1. Processes audio data from a file you upload up to 2GB or YouTube URL you specify
2. You input Speaker 1's X handle (usually the podcast host), and Speaker 2
3. Returns audio data, speaker assignments, and profile picture
4. Creates an animation around profile picture of who's speaking so you can upload and share on X easier or wherever

Currently using free X Developer API so tokens may run out for generating profile pictures
